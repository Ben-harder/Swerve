# Swerve

Swerve is a React Native app created by Jeremy Hidjaja, Adam Dixon and Ben Harder to help addicts prevent relapses. Whenever the user feels an urge to relapse, they press the swerve button and are redirected to one of ten content pages (youtube videos, pictures, websites, etc.) We are planning on adding features including search API software and user input interests. This app was created at a 24hr hackathon called LumoHacks.
