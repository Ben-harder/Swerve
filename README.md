# Swerve

Swerve is a React Native app created by Jeremy Hidjaja, Adam Dixon and Ben Harder to help addicts prevent relapses. Whenever the user feels an urge to relapse, they press the swerve button and are redirected to one of ten content pages (youtube videos, pictures, websites, etc.) Based on the concept of neuroplasticity, this process, when repeated, can help addicts physically rewire their brains to become better able to avoid relapses. 

We are planning on adding features including search API software and user input interests as well as live graphing on a user's progress in beating their addiction. This app was created at a 24hr hackathon called LumoHacks.
